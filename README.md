I want to make "an experience that lasts a lifetime."

People live through their lives remembering things. I want to make something that some people will remember with heart.

Synopsis
--------

Roy is a kid who frequently looks downwards while walking to school. There are lots of kids going to school, but Roy doesn't interact with many people. Rather, he just looks down and walk. While walking, he thinks of various things. Imagines, for example the platforms rising and him jumping and speeding through the 3-dimensional space. 

He think about how big blockade appears and him being able to out-race it in split second doing those crazy moves he can only imagine in his mind. 

'It is so cool,' he thinks to himself. He is continuously looking down walking very slowly, but his mind is at full-throttle dodging imaginary bullets and out smarting any obstructions that come about. You could say that he is in a state of ecstasy.

As he imaginarily jumps on moving platforms, his eyes are wide, his teeth clenched, his hands is pulling on his backpack with some strong grip. Now the end is near, the school entrance which coincides with his imaginary goal, a safe house, a save point.

As he passes the entrance, he grips his hand and yells internally "Yeah!!!" congratulating himself of completing this impossible mission!

This is what everyday walk to school of 12 year old boy looks like. It is beautiful, and it is very intense. 

The next day comes and the boy repeats the same thing over and over.
